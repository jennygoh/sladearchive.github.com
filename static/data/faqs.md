## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Who is involved in this project?

The [Slade Archive Project][blog] is a research project between [UCL Slade School of Fine Art][slade] and [UCL Centre for Digital Humanities][ucldh] centred on exploring and developing the Slade Archive. You can follow us on our [blog], [facebook][slade_facebook] and [twitter][slade_twitter]. 

If you are interested in having a particular photo digitised, or in supporting the Slade Archive Project more generally, please get in touch at [slade.enquiries@ucl.ac.uk][enq]

### The images are too small! Can I see a detail of a person's portrait?

Yes! Place your mouse on top of any of the faces in each group photo and a larger version should appear. If you click on it, you will be taken to an individual page for that portrait.

### How do I contribute?

We are trying to identify the people in each of the class photos. If you can recognise somebody, go to the portrait page for that person, and comment with their name, preferably in this format: Surname, Given name. We will be checking for comments and incorporating them into the index regularly.

### You've got someone wrong, can I correct it?

You certainly can! Leave a comment on the portrait page of that person, and we will correct it.

### I can't leave a comment! Where can I find help?

We are using [disqus] powered comments. You need to login using a [disqus], [facebook], [twitter] or [google] account. Disqus provides some guides if you are having trouble [commenting with disqus][commenting], [logging into disqus][logging_in] or [just using disqus comments generally][disqus_help]. 

If you are having trouble with anything else on the site, do contact us at [slade.enquiries@ucl.ac.uk][enq] and we'll try to help.
